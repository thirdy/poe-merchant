A fan made open source trading tool for Path of Exile which aims to make trading faster and improve quality of life.

Planned Features:

1. A search engine built for Path of Exile items. This will be able to understand search queries like:
 - "5L6s 2h sword"
 - "decent 30ms boots"
 - "70+ life STR gloves"
 - "5 link 6 socket"
 - "5 lnk 6 sckt"
 - "5lnk 6sckt" 
 - "5l 6s"
 - "5l6s"
 - "chest T1 life, T1 %es"
 - "perfect roll facebreaker"

2. Saved searches. If a player is looking for an upgrade for a 1h sword 250 pDPS. Then the player can saved search for "~250 pDPS 1h sword" that can be accessed easily on the side bar (or even make it as the default search result).

3. Price Check on CTRL+C. This was already done for maps and uniques via AHK script. However, there is potential to make it work with Rares. Idea is to have a configurable search params.

4. Non modal alert/dialog when a player(seller) becomes online.

5. List of shops from guild members. Items from guildmembers are highlighted. A separate search tab for guild shops.

6. QoL features like adding notes to items. Generating "Want to buy message" and copying that into the clipboard.

Below is are screenshots of the first working prototype in action:
